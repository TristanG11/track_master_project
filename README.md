## **Track Master: Autonomous Robotics Platform**

### **Overview**
Track Master is an open-source project designed to develop an autonomous robotics platform leveraging **ROS2**. The system enables precise navigation in outdoor environments, with support for differential drive control and GPS-based waypoint following.

### **Key Features**
- **GPS Navigation**: Navigate outdoor environments by following predefined GPS waypoints.
- **ROS2 Integration**: Modular and scalable architecture designed for real-time robotic systems.
- **Differential Drive**: Motorized platform using differential drive for mobility.
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combines data from GPS, IMU, and odometry for enhanced localization accuracy.
- **Simulation Support**: Fully integrated with Gazebo for testing and validation.

### **System Architecture**
- **Hardware**:
  - Microcontrollers: Arduino Mega, Raspberry Pi.
  - Sensors: GPS module, IMU .
  - Motors: Stepper motors for precise control of differential drive wheels.
  - Communication: Supports I2C, SPI, or UART interfaces.
- **Software**:
  - ROS2 as the software framework.
  - Gazebo simulation for development and testing.

### **Roadmap**
- **Enhanced Localization**: Incorporate RTK GPS for sub-meter accuracy.
- **AI Integration**: Add modules for AI-based decision-making and path planning.
- **Advanced Sensors**: Extend support for lidar for better mapping.
